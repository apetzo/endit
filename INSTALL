0. Setup TSM so that the user running dcache can "dsmc archive" and "dsmc
   retrieve" files. If you want to have several pool-nodes talking to tape,
   you probably want to setup a TSM node that you can share accross machines.
1. Unpack the tarball and put the perl script in an appropriate place,
   in this text file it is assumed they go into $DCACHE_LOCATION/jobs/
2. Create the filesystem for the pool ($fs in this file)
3. In the filesystem create directory the directories "pool", "in", "out",
   "request".
4. For the dCache pools, the "normal" size of almost the whole fs is appropriate.
   Define a dCache pool with this size on $fs/pool/.
5. Adjust the paths and hsminstance etc in the congfig file to match the install.
6. Start tsmarchiver.pl, tsmretriever.pl, and tsmdeleter.pl in the background.
7. Install the dCache endit provider-
8. Register the endit provider as an osm tape interface in dcache.
